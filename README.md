# CCPROG3-Legend
Legend is a single-player game that combines the elements of Player vs. Environment (PvE) and board games. You play as the main character, a curious adventurer who dreams of one day becoming a legend by completing an expedition to a distant land. Along the way, there are other adventurers who will attempt to stop you from achieving your goal. You are not alone, however, as you are accompanied by your faithful companions. These companions are creatures with their own unique abilities that will aid you in encounters.  The game is divided into two (2) modes: exploration and encounter. For the player to win, they must successfully traverse the game area. Encounters are triggered when the player stops or passes through certain sections of the game area. The player must defeat non-playable characters (NPCs) with the help of their companions. The player loses if all their companions are defeated.
